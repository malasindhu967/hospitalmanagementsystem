            <h3>True Healthcare For Your Family</h3>
            <p>All cardiologists study the disorders of the heart, but the study of adult and child heart disorders are through different training pathways. Therefore, an adult cardiologist (often simply called "cardiologist") is inadequately trained to take care of children, and pediatric cardiologists are not trained to take care of adult heart disease. The surgical aspects are not included in cardiology and are in the domain of cardiothoracic surgery. For example, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and valve replacement are surgical procedures performed by surgeons, not cardiologists. However, some minimally invasive procedures such as the cardiac catheterization and pacemaker implantation are performed by cardiologists with additional training in non-surgical interventions interventional cardiology and electrophysiology respectively!</p>

         <h3>Interventional cardiology</h3>
         <p>Interventional cardiology is a branch of cardiology that deals specifically with the catheter based treatment of structural heart diseases. A large number of procedures can be performed on the heart by catheterization, including angiogram, angioplasty, atherectomy, and stent implantation.</p>

         <h3>Adult cardiology</h3>
         <p> Cardiology is a specialty of internal medicine. To be a cardiologist in the United States, a three-year residency in internal medicine is followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to specialize further in a sub-specialty.</p>

         <h3> Preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation</h3>
         <p>In recent times, the focus is gradually shifting to Preventive cardiology due to increased cardiovascular Disease burden at an early age. As per WHO, 37% of all premature deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases and out of this, 82% are in low and middle income countries. Clinical cardiology is the sub specialty of Cardiology which looks after preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation.</p>

         <h3>Coronary circulation</h3>
         <p>Coronary circulation is the circulation of blood in the blood vessels of the heart muscle (myocardium). The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein and the anterior cardiac veins. </p>

         <h3>Cardiac arrhythmia</h3>
         <p>Cardiac arrhythmia, also known as "cardiac dysrhythmia" or "irregular heartbeat", is a group of conditions in which the heartbeat is too fast, too slow, or irregular in its rhythm. A heart rate that is too fast  above 100 beats per minute in adults is called tachycardia and a heart rate that is too slow  below 60 beats per minute  is called bradycardia. Many types of arrhythmia have no symptoms. When symptoms are present these may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats. More seriously there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath, or chest pain</p>

         <h3> Clinical cardiac electrophysiology</h3>
         <p> Clinical cardiac electrophysiology is a branch of the medical specialty of cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are usually referred to as electrophysiologists. </p>
